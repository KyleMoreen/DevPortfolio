                    By importing class lists from a separate file, the user 
                    is able to randomly select a student from the class list. 
                    The randomizer tracks which students have already been 
                    selected, and the selections can be saved so that the 
                    randomizer remembers which students it selected during 
                    previous sessions. This project was designed using Python 
                    and Tkinter.</div>

                    A simple card game. Both the user and the computer 
                    have cards numbered 1-10 in their hands. The player 
                    with the highest card adds both cards to their hands. 
                    If there is a tie, both cards are removed from the game.
